# FCC Remix IDE Notes on Lessons 1 to 6

These are my notes and comments that I took as I followed along the course taught by Patrick Collins. By any means is the code found in this repo my creation. If you want to access a better and more clear code, check this [original repo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js#lesson-4-remix-fund-me) where everything is posted.

I am just uploading this because Remix IDE eventually deletes your workspaces and I want to keep track of all of the notes and comments I made on the code for further studying and reviewing.
